\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have extended the Imp programming language with an addressable and mutable heap. For manipulating this heap, we have defined syntax, semantics, Hoare rules, and auxiliary theorems for verifying programs written in Imp. To be able to reason about programs using the heap, we have extended the formal system for verifying Imp programs with a separation logic.

By adding a heap, we have allowed for working with abstract data structures in Imp, which provides a considerable increase in the expressiveness of the language.

Although Imp is mainly a proof-of-concept language, the approach and formalizations presented should be generally applicable to other imperative languages.
