We present an extension of a simple imperative programming language called Imp, for which Hoare rules for basic operations have already been defined. The extension is based on an addition of an addressable and mutable state, realized as a heap, which currently does not exist for Imp. We define syntax, semantics, and Hoare rules for commands operating on such a heap, as well as redefine the logic in which Imp programs are verified. Verification using the defined Hoare rules is demonstrated through the verification of an example program. All the formalizations presented are verified with the Coq proof assistant.
