We present in this paper how separation logic can be used to reason about a mutable state in an imperative language. The language used as an example is a simple imperative language called Imp, which currently has an immutable state in form of a program stack. We extend Imps Hoare logical reasoning with separation logic, in order to also talk about the soundness of the mutable state and the correctness of a set of new operations used to transform the mutable state. To demonstrate our findings we use list reversal as an example and follow how our implementations allows this step by step.
