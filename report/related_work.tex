\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
The problem of verifying imperative languages with mutable states is a common one. In this section we present some related projects as well as alternative approaches and resources.

Appel and Blazy define formal semantics for a mid-level imperative programming language Cminor\,\cite{Appel07separationlogic}. Similar to use they have redesigned an existing imperative language, however as oppose Imp, Cminor already has the notion of a heap. Instead they have had to redesign Cminor to be suitable for Hoare logic.

Jacobs et al. use Hoare triples extended with separation logic to create a verification environment for C and Java\,\cite{Jacobs:2010:QTV:1947873.1947902}. While VeriFast offer many features that we do not, the overall approach of the two projects have many aspects in common.

Ynot is a library for Coq which turns it into an environment for writing and verifying imperative programs, which also defines a separation logic\,\cite{Ynot}. This could have been used as a base instead of defining our own separation logic.
