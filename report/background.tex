\section{Background}
\subsection{Coq}
\todo{Revise this section}
Coq is a interactive theorem prover for managing formal proofs. It is a functional programming language that implements the program specification language Gallina. Due to Gallinas base in CiC (Calculus of Inductive Constructions)\todo{Insert ref to CiC}, this provides Coq with both higher-order logics and a richly-typed functional programming language.

\subsection{Imp}
\todo{Write something about the stack / state}
As previously mentioned, Imp is a simple imperative programming language studied in the electronic book ``Software Foundations'' \footnote{Not to be confused with Irons IMP language or the Edinburgh IMP language.} implemented in Coq. The language includes some core features of widely used programming languages such as C, and certain properties about the language as a whole have been proven. This helps verification of programs written in Imp, as the precise definition of Imp can be used to formally prove that a certain program satisfies particular specifications of their behavior. 

The language has variables which can be of two types, natural numbers and booleans. These can be assigned both from values or other variables, and both come with a set of operators. Operators available for natural numbers are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), and the boolean operators are equality (==), inequality (<=), negation (not), and conjunction (and). Control flow statements for branching (if) and looping (while) are defined and proven.

The behavior of the aforementioned commands is specified with hoare triples. Below is an example of the hoare rule for assignment in Imp.
\[
    \infrule{}{
      	\triple
      		{Q\subst a X} 
      		{\;\cassign {X} {a}\;}
	  		{Q}
    }
    \]

As with the rest of the project, Imp deals with partial correctness. It is important to note that the Imp languages worked on in this project is the one defined up to the Hoare Logic chapter\footnote{http://www.itu.dk/courses/SASP/F2013/Hoare.html}, thus things like the type checker is not included.
