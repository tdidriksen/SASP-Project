\subsection{Programming with Mutable State}
Originally the state in Imp is managed by a stack, which maps variables into values. We extend this state by adding a heap, which will provide us with a mapping between addresses and value. These values represent the mutable structures. As mentioned earlier our heap only handle natural numbers.

\paragraph{}\textbf{Definition: }A heap is a mapping between an address, represented by a natural number (nat), and specific values on the heap (nat).
